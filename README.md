# Desktop Notes Display

## Project Goal

Have a physical display that can sit on my desk and show a section of my notes.
My notes are stored as markdown files and synced across devices with [syncthing](https://syncthing.net/).
There are code bases that make this up.
The main one is the firmware for a microcontroller (or controllers plural) to display text to a display.
The second is a server for hosting the notes to be retrieved by an esp MCU.
